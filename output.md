## Introduction
Dan, a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, has recently undergone knee replacement surgery. He is now presenting with swelling, redness, low-grade fever, and mild chills around the surgical site. These symptoms suggest a potential post-operative infection, which is a common complication of knee replacement surgery.

## Risk Assessment
The risk of post-operative infection after knee replacement surgery is relatively low, ranging from 1-2% [1](https://hipkneeinfo.org/knee-care/infection-and-your-knee-replacement/). However, Dan's history of diabetes may increase his risk for certain complications, such as wound infections and poor wound healing [2](https://www.premierhealth.com/your-health/articles/health-topics/diabetes-and-knee-replacement-surgery-complications). A study published in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery found that diabetic patients who underwent total knee replacement surgery did not have an increased risk of surgical complications compared to non-diabetic patients [3](https://www.kp-scalresearch.org/study-finds-that-diabetes-does-not-increase-complications-of-total-knee-replacement-surgery/).

## Clinical Presentation
Dan's symptoms, including swelling, redness, low-grade fever, and mild chills around the surgical site, are consistent with a potential wound infection. It is essential to rule out other possible causes, such as thrombophlebitis or soft tissue hematoma, before confirming an infection diagnosis [4](https://www.facs.org/-/media/files/education/core-curriculum/postoperative_care/). Assessing the wound for erythema, warmth, tenderness, and purulent discharge would be a good starting point.

## Diagnostic Evaluation
A complete blood count (CBC) may be helpful in determining the presence of leukocytosis, which is commonly seen with bacterial infections [5](https://www.woundsource.com/blog/surgical-site-infections-current-recommendations-and-guidelines). Urine analysis could also rule out urinary tract infection as a potential source of fever. Deep tissue cultures or imaging studies may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment.

## Treatment and Management
If an infection is suspected, it is crucial to initiate empirical antibiotics tailored to the most likely causative organisms in this patient population [6](https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/surgical-site-infection/index.html). The American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have established guidelines for the prevention and management of surgical site infections, including those related to knee replacement surgery [7](https://www.woundsource.com/blog/surgical-site-infections-current-recommendations-and-guidelines).

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Dan's symptoms suggest a potential post-operative infection after knee replacement surgery. A thorough evaluation, including diagnostic tests and assessment of the wound, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment. It is essential to follow established guidelines for the prevention and management of surgical site infections to minimize the risk of complications.

## Summary
Dan, a 65-year-old male with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes, presents with symptoms consistent with a potential post-operative infection after knee replacement surgery. A thorough evaluation and diagnostic tests are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment.
